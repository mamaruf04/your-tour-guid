        <h5 className="ms-3">1. What is Authentication?</h5>
        <br />
        <p className="ms-3">
          <strong>Authentication</strong> is the of validating that user are
          whom they claim to be.This is the first step in any security process
        </p>
        <br />
        <h5 className="ms-3">2. What is Authorization?</h5>
        <br />
        <p className="ms-3">
          <strong>Authorization</strong> in a system security is the process of
          giving the user permission to access a specific resource of function
        </p>
        <p>
          Difference Authorization determines the access of the resource that
          users can use. On the other hand, Authentication determine who the
          users is. Furthermore, Authorization parameter set, implement and
          maintain by the organization, however Authentication can be worked
          through password, one time pins and biometrics information which
          provided by the users. Hence, Authentication is the first and foremost
          steps for identity. But Authorization always take place after
          Authentication. In addition, Authorization isn't visible or changeable
          by the users, but Authentication is visible or partially changeable by
          user. Authentication checks credential besides Authorization checks
          permission. Moreover, both are means of access control of user.
